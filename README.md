# 🔧 Data Structures in C

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **data structures** in the C programming language. Each program demonstrates key operations with a simple menu-driven interface.

## 📁 Program List

| File Name                             | Description                                     |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `singly_linked_list_operations.c`    | Implementation of all operations on a singly linked list |
| `stack_array_implementation.c`       | Stack implementation using an array            |
| `stack_linked_list_implementation.c` | Stack implementation using linked list (pointers) |
| `circular_queue_array_implementation.c` | Circular queue using array with modulo logic |

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Insert, delete, display, search in linked list  
- ✅ Push, pop, display in stack (array and pointer-based)  
- ✅ Enqueue, dequeue, circular display in queue  
- 📚 Menu-driven programs with simple CLI

## 🛠 How to Run

1. **Compile** the code using GCC:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ```

2. **Run** the executable:
   ```bash
   ./output
   ```
> Replace `filename.c` with the name of the file you want to run (e.g., `stack_using_array.c`).
